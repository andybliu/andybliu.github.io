I am an assistant professor in the [department of history at Villanova University](https://www1.villanova.edu/villanova/artsci/history.html), about twenty minutes outside Philadelphia. My research interests include: modern China, south and east Asia, histories and theories of political economy and capitalism, and global and comparative history.

My book [***Tea War: A history of capitalism in China and India***]({% link book.md %}) was published by [Yale University Press](https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300243734/tea-war) in 2020 as part of the Weatherhead Studies in East Asia series with Columbia University. I relied upon archival materials found in China, India, and the UK, trying to bring together the histories of the Chinese and Indian tea industries into a global and comparative study of capitalism in the "rest" of the world. More links in the book section.

Right now, I am developing a second project centered on the connections between Hong Kong and Guangdong in southern China and taking place across the 1970s and eighties. From this vantage point, I hope to rethink a series of late-twentieth century transformations involving: "reform and opening" in China, the "miracle" economies of east Asia's "flying geese" and "four tiger" societies, and, more broadly, global political economy. This period is often narrated as a story of the breakdown of Fordism from the standpoint of the north Atlantic, aka, the rise of "neoliberalism." What I am trying to figure out is how much our grasp of the modern world would benefit from paying greater attention to long-term processes occurring at the same moment in the Asia-Pacific.

I am also a member of the [**Critical China Scholars collective**](https://criticalchinascholars.org/), a group of humanists and social scientists committed to advancing solidarity amidst mounting tensions between the US and China.

And I am part of a podcast called [**Time to Say Goodbye**](https://goodbye.substack.com/), with journalists Jay Caspian Kang and E. Tammy Kim. We touch on topics mostly centered on Asia and Asian America, race, politics, and pop culture.

I grew up in the Seattle suburbs and spent just over a decade in New York as a student, with time in Asia along the way. Outside of contemplating the world's problems, I spend most of my time thinking about eating noodles (spicy, wide, dry) (below) and NBA basketball. Without the Supersonics (2008, RIP), I have become an NBA generalist. Stephen Curry is my all-time favorite player. If you agree, then we will get along very well! If you disagree, you are part of the problem.
