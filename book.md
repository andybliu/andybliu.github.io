My book was published in spring 2020. The official description:

> Tea remains the world’s most popular commercial drink today, and at the turn of the twentieth century, it represented the largest export industry of both China and colonial India. In analyzing the global competition between Chinese and Indian tea, Andrew B. Liu challenges past economic histories premised on the technical “divergence” between the West and the Rest, arguing instead that seemingly traditional technologies and practices were central to modern capital accumulation across Asia.   
>He shows how competitive pressures compelled Chinese merchants to adopt abstract industrial conceptions of time, while colonial planters in India pushed for labor indenture laws to support factory-style tea plantations. 
>Characterizations of China and India as premodern backwaters, he explains, were themselves the historical result of new notions of political economy adopted by Chinese and Indian nationalists, who discovered that these abstract ideas corresponded to concrete social changes in their local surroundings.   
>Together, these stories point toward a more flexible and globally oriented conceptualization of the history of capitalism in China and India.

I envisioned this book as an intervention into debates over the history of capitalism — both old and new yet almost always centered on the north Atlantic — and also into debates over the economic comparability of Europe and Asia, aka, “the great divergence” debates. I have a longer essay expanding upon this literature, published in [the *Journal of Asian Studies* (2019)]({% link assets/ABL JAS 2019.pdf %}). 

The book itself is the product of multi-sited, comparative research, using archival materials from China, India, the UK, and Taiwan, written in Chinese, Bengali, and Japanese (and, uh, English). 

My conceptualization of the argument also drew upon a rethinking of the historical dynamics of capitalism, in particular, a rereading of Karl Marx’s mature critique of political economy. On this, see my piece [in *Spectre*, if you're curious](https://spectrejournal.com/notes-toward-a-more-global-history-of-capitalism/). 

There’s also, of course, a lot about tea, probably more than I ever needed to know. There are some funny anecdotes of British officials saying racist things, some Bengali plays and fiction, Qing officials trying to explain Adam Smith (without being able to read English), and some interesting discoveries about incense sticks and Chinese labor.

If any of this sounds interesting, you can check out [the introduction here]({% link assets/[Tea War] Introduction.pdf %}).
