<p>My book was published in spring 2020. The official description:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tea remains the world’s most popular commercial drink today, and at the turn of the twentieth century, it represented the largest export industry of both China and colonial India. In analyzing the global competition between Chinese and Indian tea, Andrew B. Liu challenges past economic histories premised on the technical “divergence” between the West and the Rest, arguing instead that seemingly traditional technologies and practices were central to modern capital accumulation across Asia. <br />
He shows how competitive pressures compelled Chinese merchants to adopt abstract industrial conceptions of time, while colonial planters in India pushed for labor indenture laws to support factory-style tea plantations. 
Characterizations of China and India as premodern backwaters, he explains, were themselves the historical result of new notions of political economy adopted by Chinese and Indian nationalists, who discovered that these abstract ideas corresponded to concrete social changes in their local surroundings. <br />
Together, these stories point toward a more flexible and globally oriented conceptualization of the history of capitalism in China and India.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I envisioned this book as an intervention into debates over the history of capitalism — both old and new yet almost always centered on the north Atlantic — and also into debates over the economic comparability of Europe and Asia, aka, “the great divergence” debates. For more on this, I have a longer essay expanding on these ideas in <a href="/assets/ABL%20JAS%202019.pdf">the <em>Journal of Asian Studies</em> (2019)</a>.</p>

<p>The book itself is the product of multi-sited, comparative research, using archival materials from China, India, the UK, and Taiwan, written in Chinese, Bengali, and Japanese (and uh English).</p>

<p>My conceptualization of the argument also drew upon an ongoing effort to reimagine the historical dynamics of capitalism, in particular, a rereading of Karl Marx’s mature critique of political economy for the contemporary world. On this, <a href="https://spectrejournal.com/notes-toward-a-more-global-history-of-capitalism/">see my piece in <em>Spectre</em></a>, if you’re into that sort of thing!</p>

<p>There’s also, of course, a lot about tea, probably more than I ever needed to know. There are some funny stories of British people saying racist things, some Bengali plays and fiction, Qing officials trying to explain Adam Smith (without being able to read English), and some interesting discoveries about incense sticks and Chinese labor.</p>

<p>If any of this sounds interesting, you can check out <a href="/assets/%5BTea%20War%5D%20Introduction.pdf">the introduction here</a>.</p>

<p>I liked <a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2021/01/tea-war-book-review-capitalism-china-india">Yueran Zhang’s review</a> below.</p>

<p><em>Tea War</em> was the recipient of the <a href="https://thebhc.org/sites/default/files/blog-post-files/2022-04/2022BHcawards.pdf">2022 Ralph Gomory prize from the Business History Conference,</a> which “recognizes historical work on the effects of business enterprises on the economic conditions of the countries in which they operate.”</p>

<p>It was also long-listed for the <a href="https://icas.asia/icas-book-prize-2021">International Convention of Asian Scholars (ICAS) 2021 book prize for best work in the humanities in English.</a>
