  <p>I am an associate professor in the <a href="https://www1.villanova.edu/university/liberal-arts-sciences/programs/history.html">department of history at Villanova University</a>, about thirty minutes outside Philadelphia. My research interests include: modern China, south and east Asia, histories and theories of political economy and capitalism, and global and comparative history.</p>

<p>My book <a href="/book/"><em>Tea War: A history of capitalism in China and India</em></a> was published by <a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300243734/tea-war">Yale University Press</a> in 2020 as part of the Weatherhead Studies in East Asia series with Columbia University. I relied upon archival materials found in China, India, and the UK, trying to bring together the histories of the Chinese and Indian tea industries into a global and comparative study of capitalism in the “rest” of the world. In spring 2022, it won the <a href="https://thebhc.org/sites/default/files/blog-post-files/2022-04/2022BHcawards.pdf">Ralph Gomory prize from the Business History Conference</a>. More in <a href="/book/">the book section</a>.</p>

<p>Right now, I am developing a second project centered on the connections between Hong Kong and Guangdong in southern China and taking place across the 1970s and eighties. From this vantage point, I hope to rethink a series of late-twentieth century transformations involving: “reform and opening” in China, the “miracle” economies of east Asia’s “flying geese” and “four tiger” societies, and, more broadly, global political economy. This period is often narrated as a story of the breakdown of Fordism from the standpoint of the north Atlantic, viz., the rise of “neoliberalism.” What I am trying to figure out is: how does our view of the modern world change when we pay serious attention to events taking place at the same moment in the Asia-Pacific?</p>

<p>I am also a member of the <a href="https://criticalchinascholars.org/">Critical China Scholars collective</a>, a group of humanists and social scientists committed to advancing solidarity amidst mounting tensions between the US and China.</p>

<p>From the outset of the Covid pandemic and for just over two years, I was part of a podcast called <a href="https://goodbye.substack.com/"><em>Time to Say Goodbye</em></a> with journalists Jay Kang and Tammy Kim (it’s still going!). We covered topics spanning global politics and culture, Asia, and Asian America. Here’s our episode on <a href="https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/asian-america-w-andy-liu-jay-caspian-kang-tammy-kim/"><em>The Dig</em> with Daniel Denvir</a> in April 2021. We were also featured by <em>Vulture</em> as one of <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/best-podcasts-of-2021.html">the top podcasts of 2021</a> and by <em>Slate</em> as one the <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2022/12/best-podcasts-2022-chat-comedy-history-politics.html">best chat podcasts of 2022.</a> More about the pod in <a href="/public/">the public writing section</a>.</p>

<p>I grew up in the Seattle suburbs and spent just over a decade in New York City as a student, with time in Asia mixed in. Outside of contemplating the world’s problems, I spend most of my time thinking about my next bowl of Asian noodles (wide, dry, spicy) (below) and NBA basketball. With the departure of my Seattle Supersonics (2008, RIP), I have become an NBA generalist. <a href="https://www.nplusonemag.com/online-only/online-only/stephen-curry-and-the-spirit-of-history/">Stephen Curry is my all-time favorite player</a>. If you agree, then we will get along! If you disagree, then you are part of the problem.</p>
